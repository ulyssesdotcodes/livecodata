// A generative hydra sketch — no 3D scene involved (src(s0) can equally post-
// process a rendered scene, sourcing whatever the 3D view draws). Press "Run"
// (or Cmd/Ctrl-Enter), then hit Play.

// A hydra table is a stream of EVENTS, each placed on the loop by its \`beat\`
// (1-indexed: beat 1 is the top of the loop). Two kinds:
//   - setCode:     \`code\` becomes the sketch — a string ending in .out(o0).
//   - setVariable: \`name\`/\`value\` sets one variable in scope while the sketch
//                  runs (e.g. freq below) — the most-recent value at each
//                  beat wins, same as setCode's code.
// Reference a variable as a FUNCTION — (props) => props.freq — rather than
// the bare name: hydra calls it fresh every frame, so the value tracks the
// table live, during playback, with no recompile/rerun. A bare \`freq\` would
// only ever see the value from when the sketch was compiled.
// Pick variable names that aren't hydra's OWN per-frame fields (time, bpm,
// fps, resolution, speed, stats) — those always win over an injected value
// of the same name, so e.g. naming this variable \`speed\` would silently be
// overridden by hydra's own playback-speed multiplier instead of your data.
//
// The loop is as many beats long as the "beats" control under the scene (16
// by default). So the freq change at beat 9 comes in halfway through the loop
// (the start of the 3rd measure) and stays until the loop wraps. Tap to
// change the tempo (how long a beat lasts); change "beats" to make the loop
// longer/shorter.
//
// editable(name, schema) makes this table live-editable in the table panel —
// it's the ONLY table this sketch needs (named "hydra" so playback reads it
// directly, with no code-generated view in between). Its rows are seeded on
// the right, so the code here carries only the schema — and \`schemas.hydra\`
// is the canonical one (hover it to see the columns): \`event\` and \`mode\`
// come as dropdowns, and \`code\` cells open in this editor with hydra
// completions. The events themselves live in the table: click the code cell
// to open the sketch here; edit a value cell, or "+ row" a new setVariable
// event at a later beat (like the beat-9 setVariable row already seeded)
// right in the table — no code change needed, and any column you add via
// "+ column" survives the next Run too. (Every edit is an event too — see
// the "hydra·events" tab.) A second, code-generated table only becomes
// useful once you need to LAYER computed events on top of these — build it
// in code and route it with .outHydra() (see "Hydra Sketch Swap"). Routing
// takes precedence over this by-name lookup, so the moment anything routes,
// route every table that should still play: table("hydra").outHydra()
// would keep this one in the mix.
//
// "disabled" is just an ordinary boolean column: check a row's box to mute
// that event — the sketch skips it, as if the row weren't there — without

//   - setCode:     \`code\` becomes the sketch — a Janet shape expression like
//                  "(union (box 60) (sphere 75))". \`t\` is the playback clock
//                  in seconds, so pausing/scrubbing the timeline freezes/
//                  scrubs the raymarch too. The dialect is bauble.studio's:
//                  box/sphere/torus/cone…, union/intersect/subtract (\`:r\` for
//                  smooth blends), rotate/move/scale, twist/bend/morph,
//                  shade/color and friends.
//   - setVariable: \`name\`/\`value\` binds a variable the sketch reads — it's
//                  compiled in as \`(def name value)\` ahead of the code. A
//                  string value is any Janet expression: value "(sin t)" makes
//                  the variable a live wave. NOTE the difference from hydra:
//                  hydra reads variables per frame through props with no
//                  recompile, but bauble BAKES them into the shader — each
//                  change recompiles the sketch. Changing on the beat grid
//                  (like size at beat 9 below) is exactly what that's for;
//                  just don't drive one from something that sweeps every frame.
//
// The exception is the camera: "camera-x" / "camera-y" (orbit, in turns of a
// full revolution) and "camera-zoom" (distance multiplier, 1 = default) are
// reserved names the renderer consumes as live uniforms — never compiled in —
// so a camera move costs nothing. The beat-5 row below steps the orbit around
