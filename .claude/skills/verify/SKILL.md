# Verifying livecodata

## Build & launch

- `npm run build` → static app in `public/`.
- `npm run serve` (PORT env, default 8787) → serves `public/` **and** the
  multiplayer WebSocket room endpoint at `/ws`. One process is enough for
  solo and multiplayer verification.
- `npm run watch` → esbuild dev server (no `/ws`; pass `?server=ws://host:8787/ws`
  to point the page at a separately-run `npm run serve`).

## Driving the app (Playwright + preinstalled Chromium)

- `npm i playwright-core` in a scratch dir; launch with
  `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`, `args: ['--no-sandbox']`.
- The editor is CodeMirror **in vim mode**: click `.cm-content`, `Escape`,
  then vim keys (`ggO` + type + `Escape`), then click `.run-btn` (or
  Ctrl-Enter) to run.
- Useful selectors: `.run-btn`, `.multiplayer-chip` (room status/peers),
  `.table-tab` / `.table-tab-add` (table panel tabs, "+ table"),
  `.session-range` (session scrubber), `.session-select` (past sessions),
  `#tap-beat-btn` / `#tap-clear-btn` / `#tap-bpm` (tap-beat controls),
  `.room-popover` + `.room-popover-input` ×2 + `.room-join-btn` (the join
  popover the chip opens when solo), `.cm-remote-cursor` /
  `.cm-remote-cursor-label` (a peer's caret + name flag in the editor).
- An editable tab's name is its `.tab-label` child — the tab's own
  `textContent` includes the `×` delete button.

## Multiplayer flows worth driving

- Two isolated contexts at `/?room=<name>`: chip goes green `⇄ <room> · 2`.
- Run code in A → B's editor updates; `+ table` in B → tab appears in A.
- Tap-beat is synced the same way: tap in A (select the "taps" tab) → rows
  appear live in B without B ever tapping; clear in either clears both.
- Late joiner receives full history on join (code + tables + taps).
- Presence (join as `/?room=<name>&user=<name>`, or via the chip's popover):
  each peer's tab gets a colored ring on the table they have open, their
  caret (with name flag) shows in the editor when both are on the same code
  cell, and the last cell they edited is outlined when its table is the one
  shown. All of it clears when the peer disconnects.
- Kill the server: chip degrades to `⇄ <room> …`, edits keep working
  locally; restart the server (rooms are memory-only) and both clients
  rejoin, re-upload logs, and converge — offline edits reach peers.

## Gotchas

- `/favicon.ico` 404s in the page console — pre-existing, benign.
- Each page load is a distinct replica (`src` id is per-load, not persisted).
- Playwright's `.click()` waits for actionability and can take 500ms-2s+ on
  this WebGL/physics-heavy page — enough to blow past the tap-beat's 2000ms
  reset-gap and make taps look like they're not accumulating. Use
  `page.evaluate(() => el.click())` (a plain JS dispatch, no actionability
  wait) when timing between taps matters.
