# Plan: math in Expr, expr cells as text, and editor-level GUI

Goal: any numeric attribute of the scene ("three") table and any post-table
variable (`set`/`pulse` `value` cells) can hold a live math expression instead
of a literal — editable from the table panel, syncing and replaying like every
other cell. Expressions gain real math (sin, min, clamp, lerp, …) and a
`progress()` source reading the enclosing event's percent-done (0→1 across
its duration).

Design principle (v2, after review): **cells store expression TEXT and the
cook evaluates it — the post-cell process, reused.** A cell holds
`=slider("h").mul(2)` (spreadsheet-style `=` prefix); the cook worker
evaluates it against the expr scope per row, producing exactly what
`derive()` produces today — a number, or a streaming `{ $expr }` binding that
playback already resolves per frame. Editing happens in the one CodeMirror
editor via the existing cell-target mode. The `{ $expr }` marker stays what
it is today: an in-memory cook artifact, regenerated every run — **never a
persisted format**.

What this deletes from the v1 (AST-in-cell) design: the bespoke bottom-sheet
token editor, the expression parser *and* pretty-printer, the node validator
and its cross-version wire-format story, the per-column `expr` flag
machinery, the Expr-instance seeding fix (seeds are strings), the slider
declaration walk (falls out of the existing path), and most of the cell-editor
safety surface. What survives untouched: the AST/consumer work (§1, §3),
which was never GUI-dependent.

---

## 1. Math in the Expr AST

### 1.1 One generic call node + a function registry

```ts
| { k: 'call'; fn: string; args: ExprNode[] }
```

with a registry as the single source of truth (the `POST_OPS` idiom):

```ts
export const EXPR_FNS: Record<string, { arity: number; apply: (...ns: number[]) => number; doc: string }>
```

Contents: `sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 abs floor ceil round sqrt exp log
sign pow min max clamp lerp fract wrap` — all pure and deterministic (no
`Math.random`, no wall clock; determinism is what makes replay/scrub exact).
Constants `pi`/`tau`/`e` as `lit` sugar. The registry feeds `evalExpr`, the
cell-eval scope (§2.2), and the editor docs (§5) — add a function once, it
appears everywhere.

### 1.2 Surface and switches

- Chainable methods (`.sin()`, `.abs()`, `.clamp(lo, hi)`, `.pow(e)`) plus
  namespace multi-arg forms (`expr.min(a, b)`, `expr.lerp(a, b, t)`). Cell
  text is evaluated as JS, so expressions are chains — `slider("h").mul(2)`,
  not infix `slider("h") * 2` (JS operators can't build AST nodes). The
  registry also provides bare wrapper fns in the cell scope (`sin(x)` ≡
  `x.sin()`) so cells read naturally.
- Both exhaustive switches learn the node (`dsl.ts`):
  - `isStreamingNode`: `case 'call': return n.args.some(isStreamingNode)` —
    critical, or `sin(slider("x"))` bakes to a constant instead of deferring.
  - `evalExpr`: look up `EXPR_FNS[n.fn]`, `Number()`-coerce args, apply.
- Runtime default without losing the compile check: bindings still cross the
  cook-transfer boundary, so give both switches a never-assert default
  (`default: { const _x: never = n; void _x; return false }`) — a forgotten
  case on the closed union stays a TS2366-style compile error while an
  out-of-type node degrades at runtime instead of NaN-ing. (With text as the
  persisted format this is belt-and-braces, not the compat story: an old
  client meeting a new function name just fails to evaluate that cell — §2.4.)
- JSDoc every new member — `gen-lang-env.js` lifts it into hover/completions
  on rebuild (§5). Keep every node kind's key set distinct from cook-transfer's
  single-key `{ $fn: string }`, and no row column named `$lineage`.

### 1.3 `progress()` — percent-done of the enclosing event

New streaming node `{ k: 'progress' }`, surfaced as `expr.progress()` /
`progress()` in cells: 0→1 across the duration of the event (row) the
expression lives on, so a `set` row can shape its own tween
(`progress().mul(tau).sin()`) and a scene keyframe its own segment.

Implementation is **substitution at fold/bake time, not a new EvalCtx
member**: the places that know both the row's window and the current frame
build a per-frame clone of the node path down to each `progress` node,
replacing it with `{ k: 'lit', v: u }` — **never mutating the source node**
(nodes live inside memoized rows; an in-place rewrite would freeze the first
u into the cook memo). Because substitution operates on bindings in rows —
however they got there — it benefits **code-created exprs identically**
(`derive({ py: expr.progress() })` on a keyframe works too):

- **post** (`post.ts` foldVars): `u = clamp01((frame - row.index) /
  durFrames)` — the u the tween already computes. `set` without `dur` → 1;
  `pulse` requires `dur` already. foldVars runs per playback frame, so this
  is a per-frame clone+eval — cheap, but the numeric-only fast path must skip
  it entirely.
- **scene** (`rasterize.ts` sampleObject): baked rows are per-frame; while
  carrying an expr value onto baked frame `i`, substitute u for that frame.
  Window, in order: the row's own `dur` if set (new semantics — transform
  keyframes don't read `dur` today); else to the **next keyframe carrying
  this field** (the per-field segment the expr spans — an any-keyframe window
  would plateau u at 1 mid-carry); else to the destroy frame or bake extent
  (thread the extent into `sampleObject`/`gatherExtra` — it lives only in
  `rasterizeRows` today). Substitution here happens once at cook; note the
  fidelity ceiling: baked u quantizes to the FRAMES_PER_BEAT=30 grid while
  `time()`-driven exprs stay continuous per render frame.
- After substitution, an expression with no other streaming node evaluates
  right there and lands as a plain number.

`isStreamingNode('progress') = true`; unsubstituted `progress` reaching
`evalExpr` evaluates to 1, the graceful degrade. This subsumes the `phase()`
idea in `notes/dsl-live-coding-plan.md` C2 for events.

### 1.4 `field()` in vars cells — same substitution

`resolveBindings` for post/hydra variables passes the **vars map** as the row
(`visualizer.ts:155,237`), so `field("beat")` in a post `value` cell would
read a sibling *variable*, not the table row. Give `field` the same fold-time
treatment: substitute `field` nodes with `lit(row[name])` where the fold has
the real row (post `foldVars`, hydra's setVariable fold at `hydra.ts:131`).
On the scene path `field()` naturally reads the baked row — no change.
Result: `field()` means "this row's columns" everywhere.

---

## 2. `=` cells: text in, binding out

### 2.1 Format

A cell whose value is a string starting with `=` is an expression cell. The
rest is a JS expression over the expr scope, evaluated to an `Expr` or a
number: `=slider("h").mul(2)`, `=progress().mul(tau).sin()`,
`=field("beat").mod(4)`. Plain JSON string — it rides the event log,
persistence, multiplayer, structured clone, and `ensure()` seed diffing with
zero new machinery, and it displays as itself (self-describing formula — no
pretty-printer). Program code seeds expr cells the same way:
`editable("fx", schema, [{ beat: 1, value: "=slider('glow')" }])` — strings,
so the v1 plan's Expr-instance structured-clone hazard never arises.

### 2.2 One shared eval module

New small module (usable from both the worker and the main thread — the
`sliderDeclsInCode` collector pattern): builds the scope — `ExprNamespace`
sources, bare `EXPR_FNS` wrappers, `progress`, `field`, plus the `expr`
namespace itself — and evaluates `text.slice(1)` with `new Function`
(the same trust model as post/hydra/code cells, which peers already sync and
evaluate). Result contract: `Expr` → `bakeExpr` per row (streaming → binding,
constant → number, exactly `derive()`'s semantics); number → itself; anything
else / throw → the cell is invalid and the cook uses the column default (the
"broken post cell declares nothing" precedent). Memoize compilation by text.

**Where it runs in the cook**: `dsl.editable()` maps served rows — evaluate
`=` cells there, per row. Because that executes inside the worker runtime,
`expr.slider("h", 0, 2)` in a cell hits the runtime's `defineSlider`
(`cook-service.ts:89`) and the control appears via the **existing**
declaration path — the v1 plan's slider-declaration walk (§2.6) is deleted,
not moved.

### 2.3 Validity and eligibility

- `cellValid` accepts an `=` string in a **number** column when it compiles
  and evaluates to Expr/number (shared module; memoized); a broken one flags
  red exactly like a wrong-typed value today. This relaxes the pinned
  number-column contract — update `test/editable-tables.test.ts`
  deliberately.
- **Timing columns**: an `=` cell whose result is *streaming* is invalid in
  `beat`/`dur`/`end`/`loop` (a hardcoded name set, the RESERVED/NO_TRACK
  precedent) — a binding there NaNs rasterize's frame math and drops rows
  from the timeline strip, all silently. A *constant* expr in those columns
  is fine: it evaluates to a plain number before anything sees it.
- **Row-level rule** (in `invalidColumns`, which sees the whole row): hydra
  `replace` rows reject `=` values — the fold splices `String(row.value)`
  into sketch code (`hydra.ts:142`). Post `layer` needs no rule (`amountExpr`
  already degrades objects to `'0.5'`); bauble `value` exprs are simply
  documented as recompile-per-frame (constant exprs fine); particles ignore
  non-numbers today (inert, documented).

### 2.4 Version skew, solved by text

Old clients meeting a cell that uses a newer function get a `ReferenceError`
at eval → invalid-red cell + column default at cook. No NaN, no crash, no
persisted-AST versioning: text is the format, and bindings remain cook-local.

### 2.5 Cell editing: cell-target mode first, inline mini-editor for quick edits

`EditableCell` gets one small dispatch: an `=`-string value routes to the
code-cell path instead of the primitive inline editors. Display needs one
branch: `formatEditableCell`'s number arm shows `=`-strings as-is (covers
cells, timeline-strip readouts, events tabs). To *create* an expr from a
number cell, typing `=` as the first character switches the cell into
expression editing (spreadsheet muscle memory; the inline input becomes
`type="text" inputmode="decimal"` so `=` is typable). This also closes the
v1 clobber hazard — an `=` cell never opens the coercing number editor.

**Phase 2 (zero new UI)**: the dispatch targets `props.onEditCell` —
`main.ts:117-144` already expands the collapsed mobile editor, opens
cell-target mode with a language, and its commit **already** does
`setCell` + `evaluate(liveCode, { seed: liveSeed })` (a commit is a full
Apply of all pending edits at the last-applied program, same as code cells
today).

**Phase 4: an inline mini CodeMirror in the cell.** The app's single
EditorView is a choice, not a constraint — CM6 is multi-view by design, and
every language-service source is a stateless factory over the shared
`LangClient` with a `getLang` closure (`editor-support.ts:169-343`), so a
second minimal view gets completions/hover/signature by calling the same
factories with a cell-scoped closure. Shape:

- **One lazily-created instance**, owned outside the render tree and
  reparented into the editing cell's `td` (keeps identity across the panel's
  tick-driven rebuilds — the slider panel's documented invariant); language
  swapped per edit via a `Compartment`. Extensions: bare `javascriptLanguage`
  + the completion/hover factories + `oneDark` + the §4 scrubber/token-bar —
  no basicSetup chrome, no vim, no remote cursors (those stay main-editor
  concerns).
- **Grid semantics preserved**: a `Prec.highest` keymap maps Enter →
  commit + refocus grid, Tab → commit + advance, Escape → cancel — the same
  contract as the primitive inline editors, wired to the existing
  `commit()`/`advanceEdit` machinery; `guardFocus`'s selector grows
  `.cm-content`. Autogrow to a few lines, overlaying the row at a usable
  min-width (the measured-popover pattern) rather than squeezing into the
  column.
- **Expand affordance**: a corner button hands the buffer to full
  cell-target mode for long edits — the main editor stays the home of docs,
  vim, and multi-line work; inline is the quick path (especially on mobile,
  where it avoids the collapse/expand pane jump entirely).
- Commit stays the explicit gesture (Enter/Apply); outside-click cancels,
  like every inline editor today.

Editor language: start with `'dsl'` (the TS service already completes
`expr.*` and Expr-method chains — test-pinned); add an `'expr'` lang-env
entry later for bare-name completions (`slider(`, `sin(`) via the documented
`CodeLanguage`/`EditorLang`/`env.langs` recipe (§5). The inline editor also
serves plain `code` columns for quick tweaks — same dispatch, same expand
hatch — so post/hydra cells gain it too.

## 3. Consumers (unchanged from v1 — never GUI-dependent)

### 3.1 Scene ("three") table path

1. **`schemas.scene`** (new SCHEMAS entry + docs + a sample): `{ beat, id,
   type: ['create','update','destroy'], shape: [...], px..pz, rx..rz,
   sx..sz, color, dur, ease: ['linear','easeIn','easeOut','easeInOut'],
   disabled }`. Rasterize gains post-style `easingOf(string)` resolution —
   today it only honors function `ease`, which JSON cells can't hold, so
   editable keyframes always play linear. That fix stands alone.
2. **rasterize**: expr bindings join the per-field track scan as first-class
   keyframe values — a bolt-on carry pass is not enough, because the track
   write is the *last* writer into the baked row and would clobber the expr.
   Binding-valued keys join `names` (`:105`) and the prev/next scan (`:113`);
   lerp only when both prev and next are numbers, else hold prev (with the
   per-frame progress-substituted clone when prev is a binding). Expr
   keyframes thereby *terminate* numeric segments; numeric↔expr transitions
   **step** — gliding is expressed inside the expr via `progress()`/`time()`.
   Applies to **every tracked field, not just RESERVED** (light/camera
   numerics ride gatherExtra *and* the track loop; today the numeric track
   actively overwrites an expr update there). `color`: expr as step only;
   the `dur` pulse path bit-ops the value, so the row rule forbids that
   combination. This fix equally benefits code-created bindings
   (`derive` onto update keyframes is silently dropped today).
3. **three-scene**: sweep transform paths to guarded numerics
   (`numOr(v, default)`) — an unresolved/NaN value currently vanishes the
   mesh with no error; the error surface should be the invalid-cell flag,
   not a missing object.

### 3.2 Post variables path

`foldVars` (`post.ts:162-220`): tween guard requires numeric prev+target
(expr degrades to a step), a non-numeric base silently **drops pulses**, and
pulse values coerce to 0. Rework with composite nodes — the fold *constructs*
bindings, no EvalCtx needed:

- Tween with expr endpoint(s): emit `{ $expr: {k:'call', fn:'lerp',
  args:[prevNode, targetNode, lit(easedU)]} }` — u/ease are known per frame
  at fold time; endpoints resolve at the visualizer's existing
  `resolveBindings(frame.vars, ctx)`.
- Pulses over any base: nested `{k:'bin', op:'add'/'mul'}` nodes:
  `add(baseNode, mul(pulseNode, lit(env)))`.
- Numeric-only rows keep today's arithmetic fast paths byte-for-byte (pinned
  tests unchanged). `progress`/`field` substitution (§1.3/1.4) happens here.
- Cook/replay callers run foldVars ctx-free — composites keep that total, and
  `stateId` never sees set/pulse values, so exprs can't force a recompile.
- `val()`-derived rows: the dirty flag already protects a user's `=` edit
  from re-derivation clobbering. Two-clocks caveat to document: expr `time()`
  is source position; a chain's `p.time` is pass-adjusted (same as `derive()`
  today).

---

## 4. GUI: editor affordances that pay everywhere

The v1 bespoke bottom-sheet is replaced by CodeMirror extensions on the one
editor — which means every affordance works in expr cells, post/hydra/bauble
cells, **and the main program** (exprs created in code get the same tools):

- **Number-literal scrubbing** (the centerpiece): a decoration extension that
  detects numeric literals and lets you drag them — pointer capture +
  movement threshold (the timeline-strip pattern), horizontal to scrub,
  vertical distance for coarse/fine, `touch-action: none` on the handle.
  Scrubbing edits the document text and nothing else — release just leaves
  the new literal in the buffer, exactly like typing it; Apply/Ctrl-Enter
  (or Run for the program) remains the one sync point, and the canvas never
  follows an unapplied buffer. One extension delivers the sheet's marquee
  interaction to every literal in every language: `bloom(0.6)` in a post
  cell, `value: 0.35` in the program, the `2` in `=slider("h").mul(2)`.
- **Mobile token bar**: a small insert-toolbar above the editor (a Solid
  sibling of the editor chrome, inserting at the cursor) — `slider("")`,
  `midi("")`, `time()`, `progress()`, `field("")`, `.mul()` `.add()`,
  `sin()` … Shown in cell-target mode on coarse pointers; useful for post
  cells too. Slider insertion needs no declaration plumbing — the cook
  declares on evaluation (§2.2).
- **Completions/hover**: already exist via the TS service; an `'expr'`
  lang-env entry adds bare-name completions for `=` cells (§5).
- **Later**: inline evaluated-value annotations (a widget showing what an
  expr/literal currently evaluates to at the playhead — needs a
  `getEvalCtxAt(srcFrame)` accessor on the playback API); color swatches on
  hex literals. Both are editor-level and language-agnostic, so they too
  benefit code and cells alike.

What's consciously given up vs the sheet: structured always-valid editing
(mid-edit text can be broken — the red flag + Apply gating already handle
that for every code cell) and chip-tap ergonomics for *building* expressions
on a phone (mitigated by the token bar + completions; and most edits after
creation are number tweaks, which the scrubber owns).

---

## 5. Editor, docs, completions

- JSDoc on new `Expr`/`ExprNamespace` members → regenerate `lang-env.json`
  (build already does) → TS-service completions/hover pick them up; bump the
  service-worker precache. Extend the hand-kept
  `EXPR_METHOD_DOCS`/`EXPR_NAMESPACE_DOCS` (`editor-support.ts:95-120`) —
  they drive curated prose, completion boost, the offline fallback, and the
  DocsPopover reference.
- `'expr'` as a `CodeLanguage`+`EditorLang` with its own env.langs roots
  (bare expr surface) — the recipe is documented in the recon: add to both
  unions, one `env.langs` entry in `gen-lang-env.js`, and the
  `editor-support.ts` gates; `main.ts` forwards declared languages unchanged.
  Ship after the core lands; `'dsl'` completions suffice meanwhile.

---

## 6. Tests (behavioral contracts only, per CLAUDE.md)

- **expr**: call-node eval for a representative spread (`sin`, `clamp`,
  `lerp`); streaming-ness propagates through call args; hash stability.
- **cell eval**: `=` text → binding for streaming, → number for constant;
  broken text → invalid + column default; `expr.slider` in a cell declares
  through the runtime; evaluation is deterministic across worker/main.
- **progress**: a post `set` with `dur` using `progress()` resolves 0→1
  across the window and 1 after; a scene keyframe sees per-field segment
  progress; progress-only exprs bake to numbers; source nodes never mutated
  (memo safety).
- **rasterize**: the numeric/expr/numeric keyframe sandwich samples the expr
  in its span (no lerp-through) — for a RESERVED field *and* a non-reserved
  light numeric; string `ease` resolves via EASINGS.
- **post fold**: tween with an expr target emits a per-frame-resolving lerp
  composite; a pulse over an expr base stacks (today: dropped); numeric-only
  rows byte-match today (existing pinned tests unchanged); `field()` in a
  value cell reads the row, not sibling vars.
- **cells/validity**: `=` accepted in number columns, streaming-`=` rejected
  in timing columns, hydra `replace` `=` rejected (update the pinned
  `cellValid` test); `=` cells display as themselves.

---

## 7. Phasing

1. **Core AST** — call node + registry + `progress`/`field` substitution
   rules + never-assert defaults + JSDoc/docs/lang-env. Pure, no UI.
2. **`=` cells** — shared eval module, `dsl.editable()` evaluation,
   `cellValid` arms (number/timing/replace rules), `formatEditableCell`
   branch, `EditableCell` dispatch to cell-target mode, `=`-typed handoff.
   Ships end-to-end usable (typed exprs, editor completions, apply-on-commit)
   before any new GUI exists.
3. **Consumers** — post foldVars composites + substitutions, rasterize
   binding keyframes in the track scan + progress substitution + string
   ease, `schemas.scene`, three-scene NaN guards.
4. **Editor affordances** — inline mini CodeMirror in cells (§2.5),
   number-literal scrubber extension, mobile token bar, `'expr'` lang-env
   entry; sample + tutorial text. The scrubber and token bar are extension
   arrays shared by both views, so they land in cells and the main editor
   together.
5. **Polish** — inline evaluated-value annotations (playback ctx accessor),
   graph markers for expr rows, bauble/`layer` revisit, resolve-then-lerp
   keyframe glides.
